# _OLLIE_NAME_START_CASE_

> Additional information or tag line

A brief description of your project, what it is used for.

## Installing / Getting started

A quick introduction of the minimal setup you need to get a hello world up &
running.

```shell
commands here
```

Here you should say what actually happens when you execute the code above.

## Developing

### Built With
List main libraries, frameworks used including versions (React, Angular etc...)

- [Express.js](http://expressjs.com)

### Prerequisites
What is needed to set up the dev environment. For instance, global dependencies or any other tools. include download links.

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com)
- [Nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)


### Setting up Dev

Here's a brief intro about what a developer must do in order to start developing
the project further:

```shell
yarn install

docker-compose up -d

# modify .env variables
cp .env.example .env
```

#### 1. Run the setup script

Run the app for production:

```bash
yarn start
```

Run the app for development. With this invocation, nodemon is used for an automated restart on file change:

```bash
yarn watch
```



### Testing

Run full test suite:

```bash
$ yarn test test
```

### Building
If your project needs some additional steps for the developer to build the
project after some code changes, state them here. for example:

```shell
yarn build
```

Here again you should state what actually happens when the code above gets
executed.

### Deploying / Publishing
Give instructions on how to build and release a new version
In case there's some step you have to take that publishes this project to a
server, this is the right time to state it.

```shell
./scripts/deploy.sh (develop|staging|production)
```

And again you'd need to tell what the previous code actually does.

## Versioning

We can maybe use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning. For the versions available, see the [link to tags on this repository](/tags).


## Configuration

Here you should write what are all of the configurations a user can enter when
using the project.

## Tests

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.
Explain what these tests test and why.

```shell
Give an example
```

## Style guide

Explain your code style and show how to check it.


## Api Reference

If the api is external, link to api documentation. If not describe your api including authentication methods as well as explaining all the endpoints with their required parameters.


## Database

Explaining what database (and version) has been used. Provide download links.
Documents your database design and schemas, relations etc... 

## Licensing

State what the license is and how to find the text version of the license.
